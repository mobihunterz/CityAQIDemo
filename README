This application lists a list of city with their respective AQI levels.

City-wise AQI data is fetched from websocket and pushed into Local Database (RealmDB) and then this data will be fetched from DB to load on Listing screen and Graph screens.


*Installation
- Clone this Repo <master> branch.
- Install pods using `pod install`.
- Run the app.


*Testcases
I have implemented relevant test cases to improve code coverage and fixated UI with data.
XCTestCase implementation also tests RealmDB changes.

To test the build use 'Command + U' or Run Test build.
